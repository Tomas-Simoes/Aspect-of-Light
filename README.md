<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

My team and I are firmly dedicated to developing a video game that expertly blends the elements of mystery and exploration with the challenging gameplay mechanics that are inherent in the widely popular 2D Souls-like genre. 

Our game, "Aspect of Light", is currently under development, and although still in its early stages, we remain resolute in our unwavering commitment to providing our players with an exceptional gaming experience.

<!-- CONTROLS -->
## Controls
The video game currently lacks a tutorial; therefore, we will provide the game controls below for the time being.

* WASD to move
* Arrows to move on the UI
* E to dash
* Q to interact (to talk to the NPCs for example)
* ENTER to select
