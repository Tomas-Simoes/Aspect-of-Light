<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is our final school project done in Unity.
It is a top-down combat and story game, with a unique experience for each player, as the map is randomly created each gameplay and the story is also shown to each player randomly in different stages of the game.

Main Objectives:
* Fun, challenging, and responsive combat with multiple enemies, each with different abilities and behaviors.
* Complex storyline for the player to explore throughout the game.
* Different scenarios with innovative mechanics
