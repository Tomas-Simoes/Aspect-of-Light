<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is our final school project done in Unity.
It is a top-down combat and story game, with a unique experience for each player, as the map is randomly created each gameplay and the story is also shown to each player randomly in different stages of the game.

Main Objectives:
* Fun, challenging, and responsive combat with multiple enemies, each with different abilities and behaviors.
* Complex storyline for the player to explore throughout the game.
* Different scenarios with innovative mechanics

<!-- CONTROLS -->
## Controls
The game doesn't have any tutorial yet, so for now we'll put the game controls here.

* WASD to move
* Arrows to move on the UI
* E to dash
* Q to interact (to talk to the NPCs for example)
* Enter to select (options in the menus for example)
* In the bottom right from the screen, there is an "Inventory" button. There you can choose to equip some abilities and use them. The keys to use them are: 1, 2 and 3. To equip any ability, you should press the slot where do you want to equip the ability and then press the ability to equip
